What is 300CMS?
===============

300CMS is a CMS written in PHP which is exactly 300 bytes (except for the Markdown parser) and does not use a database. It is easy to set up, and content is added as plain text files in [Markdown][markdown] format.

How do I install it?
====================
Installing is as easy as putting the required files on a web server.

How do I use it?
================
300CMS consists of 6 files:

    index.php
    markdown.php
    pages [DIR]
    --404.txt
    --index.txt
    theme [DIR]
    --style.css
    theme.html

 - The `pages` directory contains all pages, in Markdown format with the `.txt` file extension.
 - The `theme` directory contains all files the theme needs.
 - `theme.html` is the main theme file. Somewhere in this file there is `{{{CONTENT}}}` which gets replaced by the parsed Markdown.

Just make as much pages as you want, by putting them into the `pages` directory. The page you want to view is given with the `p` query string parameter, e.g. `http://www.example.com/?p=foo`. You could use a `.htaccess` file to rewrite this if you like.
